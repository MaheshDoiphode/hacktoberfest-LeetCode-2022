You are given a stream of n videos, each represented by a distinct number from 1 to n that you need to "upload" to a server. You need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the longest uploaded prefix at various points in the upload process.

We consider i to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range 1 to i (inclusive) have been uploaded to the server. The longest uploaded prefix is the maximum value of i that satisfies this definition.

Implement the LUPrefix class:

LUPrefix(int n) Initializes the object for a stream of n videos.
void upload(int video) Uploads video to the server.
int longest() Returns the length of the longest uploaded prefix defined above.
 

Example 1:

Input
["LUPrefix", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest"]
[[4], [3], [], [1], [], [2], []]
Output
[null, null, 0, null, 1, null, 3]

Explanation
LUPrefix server = new LUPrefix(4);   // Initialize a stream of 4 videos.
server.upload(3);                    // Upload video 3.
server.longest();                    // Since video 1 has not been uploaded yet, there is no prefix.
                                     // So, we return 0.
server.upload(1);                    // Upload video 1.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 1.
server.upload(2);                    // Upload video 2.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1,2,3] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 3.

class LUPrefix(n: Int) {

    private val N = 101000
    private val visited = BooleanArray(N)
    private var index = 1

    fun upload(video: Int) {
        visited[video] = true
        while (visited[index]) {
            index++
        }
    }

    fun longest(): Int {
        return index - 1
